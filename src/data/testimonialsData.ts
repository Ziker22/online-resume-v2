    text: "I worked with Juraj on several streams. Juraj was not only a very senior developer but he proved excellent leadership skills on all the projects. He was the main counterpart for the customer converting customer's ideas into architecture and design. There are some other benefits working with Juraj though. He is a guy you enjoy lot of fun with and therefor he was also naturally helping building the right team spirit across the Bratislava branch and whole my department of 100+ devs at that time. If you want a guy who will make things done and improve your team spirit, Juraj is the one!",

He delivers work extremely fast without compromising quality—in fact, quite the opposite. He always looks for the best solution to any problem, using his technical expertise and thoughtfully challenging business and product ideas.

    text: "Juraj is an exceptional front-end lead because he cares about code quality as well as crafting delightful user experiences. I loved working with Juraj on projects and our design system because he was engaged, responsive, knowledgeable, and delivered work to a high standard. He provided an alternative perspective that was both insightful and challenging, which I greatly valued. He constantly challenges those around him to do their best work, and his ability to see things differently helped me grow and become a better designer. Juraj was fundamental in changing the approach to front-end development at 7bridges, significantly raising the bar in terms of quality and standards. I always felt confident working on projects with him, knowing the front end would be handled to the highest level. Juraj's combination of passion, extensive knowledge, and collaborative nature makes him a standout front-end lead who continually inspires others and elevates the work of those around him.",

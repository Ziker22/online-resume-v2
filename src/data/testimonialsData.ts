    text: "Juraj is technically strong, does a good job understanding business goals, and really helped reset and establish good front end engineering architecture and processes for us, as well as executing on a daily basis on a wide range of features and experiences. He understands when to be pragmatic but also has a clear idea of what good looks like. I'm very glad I was able to work with him, and see him as a strong team contributor.",

    text: "I worked with Juraj for a few months, and I will remember those days for a long time. Juraj is a very skilled and capable programmer, excelling in many areas. He delivers work extremely fast without compromising quality—in fact, quite the opposite. He always looks for the best solution to any problem, using his technical expertise and thoughtfully challenging business and product ideas. Juraj is great at leading and teaching junior colleagues and always supports his team when needed. The only downside is that our cooperation was too short.",

    text: "I worked with Juraj on several streams. Juraj was not only a very senior developer but he proved excellent leadership skills on all the projects. He was the main counterpart for the customer converting customer's ideas into architecture and design. There are some other benefits working with Juraj though. He is a guy you enjoy lot of fun with and therefor he was also naturally helping building the right team spirit across the Bratislava branch and whole my department of 100+ devs at that time. If you want a guy who will make things done and improve your team spirit, Juraj is the one!",
